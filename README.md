Python-Guitar:

Info:
This repository is a collection of python scripts that I made
that are intended for use with guitar or other musical instruments.
These were made not only to imporve my python skills but 
also to improve my music theory through converting it
into code.

Scales:
The first script added is named scales and it is a simple
cmd-line application of python that gives out 8 different scales
in any of the 12 keys. The user can select if they want to see
sharps or flats. The theory behind it might need some work
but from my knowgledge it works.
